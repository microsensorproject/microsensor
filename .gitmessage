[optional body]
    More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters.
    The blank line separating the summary from the body is
    critical (unless you omit the body entirely).

    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

    - Bullet points are okay, too.
    - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet,
    followed by a single space. Use a hanging indent.
